Crassostrea virginica sequence assembly release C_virginica-1.0 notes:

We have sequenced the genome of the Eastern oyster using DNA from a gynogenetic oyster of an inbred line produced at the Haskin Shellfish Research Laboratory, Rutgers University, known as sample RU13XGHG1-28 from either a single tissue or pooled extracts from two tissues (mantle, adductor muscle). Sequences were generated on the Pacific Biosciences RSII instrument (P6/C4 chemistry) to ~74x genome coverage based on a genome size estimate of 675 Mb.  All reads were assembled with the FALCON algorithm then error corrected using the Quiver and Pilon algorithms. Scaffolds were generated with the SSPACE-LongRead software.

Of the 685 Mb genome (C_virginica-1.0), the total assembly N50 contig and scaffold lengths are 1.97Mb (n=690) and 2.79Mb (n=358), respectively.
